- **Fail-Closed Security**: All authorization errors now return 403 responses with minimal context, ensuring attackers cannot distinguish between different failure modes or gain system insights
- **Storage Resilience**: Authorization system maintains security posture even during storage failures - no 500 errors that could indicate system health or internal architecture
- **Production Hardening**: Complete isolation of development features from production environments, preventing accidental test data creation or debug information exposure
- **Security Through Obscurity**: Minimal error messages prevent reconnaissance while maintaining usability for legitimate users and debugging capability for administrators
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Authorization system now meets enterprise security standards for information disclosure prevention, fail-closed behavior, and defense in depth

**SECURITY VALIDATION**: Architect review confirmed PASS rating - authorization system demonstrates production-ready security posture with no critical vulnerabilities, proper error handling, and enterprise-grade security controls.

**Key Security Improvements**:
- **Before**: 500 errors exposed internal system state, detailed permission arrays revealed system structure
