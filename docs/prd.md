# Enterprise AI Application Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

The following bullet points represent the desired outcomes this PRD will deliver if successfully implemented:

- Deploy enterprise-grade AI applications in under 15 minutes to capture share of the $30B+ no-code market
- Achieve 90% development acceleration and 70% cost reduction for Fortune 500 companies through AI-first architecture
- Generate $2M+ ARR within 24 months by serving 100+ Fortune 500 customers with clear ROI demonstration
- Establish market leadership position as top 3 AI-first enterprise platform in no-code segment
- Enable progressive onboarding that eliminates feature overwhelm while maximizing conversion through role-based paths
- Deliver industry-specific templates (Healthcare, Finance, E-commerce) with verified customer success stories and demonstrated ROI
- Provide multi-model AI integration (OpenAI GPT-4, Claude) with enterprise governance and compliance features
- Achieve 94% customer satisfaction with $180k average annual ROI per organization

### Background Context

The Enterprise AI Application Platform addresses a critical gap in the rapidly expanding no-code/low-code market, which is projected to grow from $30.1B in 2024 to $187B by 2030 at a 28.1% CAGR. Current solutions like Zapier and Monday.com lack AI-first architecture and fail to deliver on promises of rapid deployment, leaving enterprises struggling with 6-12 month development cycles and $1.7M annual spending on manual processes that could be automated.

Our platform leverages Replit's integrated environment with latest AI models to provide zero-shot development capabilities, enabling full-stack applications to be built without manual coding. By combining progressive onboarding, industry-specific templates with proven ROI, and multi-model AI capabilities, we're positioning to directly compete with established players while capturing the AI-native market opportunity. The timing is critical as AI development capabilities reach production-grade maturity and enterprises increasingly seek automation solutions with clear business value.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision**: Single-service monorepo with shared schema architecture
**Rationale**: For MVP, a monorepo approach maximizes development velocity and simplifies deployment while maintaining clean separation between frontend and backend. This supports the AI-assisted development approach and enables rapid iteration on the <15 minute deployment target.

### Service Architecture

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Unified full-stack application architecture with thin backend pattern

The platform implements a monolithic full-stack application optimized for rapid development and deployment:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript as primary application layer handling most business logic
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript serving as thin API layer for data persistence and AI integration
- **AI Orchestration**: Dedicated service layer for managing OpenAI and Claude model interactions
- **Data Layer**: MemStorage for MVP with PostgreSQL migration path for enterprise scaling

**Rationale**: This architecture maximizes frontend capabilities while minimizing backend complexity, aligning with the zero-shot development goal and enabling AI agents to work efficiently within their context limits.

### Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Unit + Integration testing approach with manual testing convenience methods

Testing strategy balances automation with rapid development:
- **Unit Testing**: Core business logic and utility functions with Jest/Vitest
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoints and AI model integration with proper mocking
- **Manual Testing Convenience**: Automated setup for manual QA testing of user flows
- **End-to-End**: Selective E2E tests for critical conversion paths (onboarding, deployment)

**Rationale**: Supports the 4-6 week development cycle while ensuring enterprise-grade reliability for the target Fortune 500 customer base.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Platform Integration**: Full utilization of Replit platform ecosystem including Auth, Object Storage, and Secrets management for enterprise-grade security
- **AI Model Management**: OpenAI GPT-4 as primary model with Claude integration for backup and specialized tasks, with function calling capabilities for workflow automation
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for streaming AI responses and real-time collaboration features
- **Performance Optimization**: Frontend-heavy architecture with client-side state management to minimize API calls and optimize for <200ms response times
- **Data Migration Strategy**: Clear migration path from MemStorage to PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM to support enterprise scaling requirements
- **Deployment Strategy**: Replit platform deployment with consideration for enterprise compliance and multi-tenant architecture in post-MVP phases
- **Cost Management**: Initial development within Replit free-tier constraints with premium feature scaling for enterprise customers
- **Security Framework**: Implementation of basic security for MVP with clear roadmap to SOC 2 Type II and GDPR compliance for enterprise adoption
