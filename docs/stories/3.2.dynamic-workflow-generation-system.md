# Story 3.2: Dynamic Workflow Generation System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** System,  
**I want** to generate multi-step business workflows with routing logic,  
**so that** generated applications handle complex business processes automatically.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Workflow generator creates sequential, parallel, and conditional workflow patterns from requirements
2. System generates approval chains with role-based routing and escalation logic
3. Generated workflows include automated notifications, reminders, and deadline management
4. Workflow engine supports conditional branching based on form data and business rules
5. Generated workflows integrate with external services for validation and data processing
6. Workflow execution includes comprehensive audit trails and status tracking
7. Generated workflow UI provides progress visualization and user task management
8. Workflows support dynamic assignment and reassignment of tasks based on availability

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Workflow pattern generation (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Implement sequential workflow generation with step dependencies
  - [ ] Create parallel workflow generation with synchronization points
  - [ ] Add conditional workflow patterns with branching logic using state machines
  - [ ] Generate approval chains with role-based routing and escalation rules
- [ ] Business process automation (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Implement automated notification and reminder systems with email/SMS integration
  - [ ] Create deadline management with escalation triggers and SLA monitoring
  - [ ] Add external service integration points for validation and processing
  - [ ] Generate comprehensive audit trail and status tracking capabilities
- [ ] Workflow UI generation (AC: 7, 8)
  - [ ] Create workflow progress visualization components using React/Shadcn UI
  - [ ] Generate user task management interfaces with assignment capabilities
  - [ ] Implement dynamic task assignment based on user availability and roles
  - [ ] Add real-time workflow status updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Integration with form and chatbot systems (AC: 4, 6)
  - [ ] Connect workflow engine with dynamic form generation service
  - [ ] Integrate embedded AI chatbots for workflow guidance and assistance
  - [ ] Add conditional logic based on form data and AI-powered business rules
  - [ ] Implement workflow state persistence and recovery mechanisms

## Dev Notes

### Workflow Engine Architecture
**State Machine Pattern**: Custom workflow execution engine with persistent state management  
**Integration Points**: Connect with form generation and chatbot embedding services for unified experience  
**UI Generation**: React components for workflow visualization and task management using Shadcn UI  
**Business Rules**: AI-generated conditional logic with validation and intelligent routing decisions
