# Story 2.2: Business Requirements Extraction Engine

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** System,  
**I want** to automatically extract structured requirements from natural language descriptions,  
**so that** I can generate complete business applications without manual configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AI engine extracts workflow steps from descriptions ("document collection → background check → manager approval")
2. System identifies form field requirements with proper data types and validation rules
3. Engine recognizes approval chains, routing logic, and conditional business rules
4. AI extracts integration requirements (email, SMS, APIs) from business context automatically
5. System maps business terminology to technical implementations with >90% accuracy
6. Requirements extraction handles complex multi-step processes with parallel workflows
7. Engine identifies where embedded AI chatbots should provide user guidance
8. Structured output follows BusinessRequirement schema for application generation pipeline

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Core NLP extraction service (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [ ] Implement OpenAI-powered requirement extraction with custom prompts using function calling
  - [ ] Create workflow pattern recognition for sequential and parallel processes
  - [ ] Add form field inference with data type and validation rule extraction
  - [ ] Implement multi-step process analysis with dependency mapping
- [ ] Business logic extraction (AC: 3, 4)

  - [ ] Create integration requirement identification for external services (email, SMS, APIs)
  - [ ] Add conditional business rule extraction from natural language
  - [ ] Build decision logic mapping for automated workflow routing
- [ ] Terminology mapping (AC: 5, 8)
  - [ ] Create business-to-technical terminology mapping service with >90% accuracy
  - [ ] Implement structured output generation following BusinessRequirement schema
  - [ ] Add accuracy validation and confidence scoring for extracted requirements
  - [ ] Build business domain knowledge base for context-aware mapping
- [ ] AI assistance point identification (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement AI chatbot placement recommendation engine
  - [ ] Create guidance point identification for form assistance and process help
  - [ ] Add contextual assistance mapping for embedded AI integration
  - [ ] Define chatbot capability requirements per assistance point

## Dev Notes

### NLP Service Architecture
**OpenAI Integration**: GPT-4 with specialized business extraction prompts and function calling for structured output  
**Schema Compliance**: All output must match BusinessRequirement model from shared/schema.ts  
**Function Calling**: Use OpenAI function calling for consistent structured data extraction  
**Business Domain Knowledge**: Maintain knowledge base of common business patterns and terminology
