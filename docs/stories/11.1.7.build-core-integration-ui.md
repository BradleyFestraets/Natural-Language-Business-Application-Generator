# Story 11.1.7: Build Core Integration UI (Workflow Designer)

**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** a visual dashboard to create and monitor cross-system workflows,
**so that** I can automate complex business processes.

## Story Overview

This story creates the user interface for the Cross-System Integration service. It involves building a dashboard to create, view, and execute business workflows. This is a complex UI that may require a visual designer component. This UI will consume the endpoints from the Integration API (Story 11.1.5).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new page is created at `client/src/pages/integration-dashboard.tsx`.
- [ ] The page provides an interface to create a new business workflow by calling the `POST /api/integration/workflows` endpoint.
- [ ] The dashboard displays a list of existing workflows, fetched from the API.
- [ ] Users can view the details and status of a specific workflow.
- [ ] The UI is built using `Shadcn UI` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- [ ] State management is handled by `React Query`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Set up Integration Page and Routing**
    - [ ] Create `client/src/pages/integration-dashboard.tsx`.
    - [ ] Add a route (e.g., `/integration`) to the page.

- [ ] **Task 2: Build Workflow List**
    - [ ] Create a component to display a list of business workflows.
    - [ ] Use `React Query` to fetch data from the API.

- [ ] **Task 3: Build Workflow Designer/Creator**
    - [ ] Create a component for creating a new workflow. This may involve a form-based or a visual (drag-and-drop) interface.
    - [ ] Use `React Query`'s `useMutation` hook to post data to the `POST /api/integration/workflows` endpoint.

- [ ] **Task 4: Build Workflow Detail/Monitoring View**
    - [ ] Create a component to display the details and execution history of a single workflow.

## Dev Notes

-   **Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Wouter.
-   **API Endpoints**: This story consumes the endpoints defined in story `11.1.5`.
-   **Complexity**: The workflow designer is a complex component. Consider using a library like `React Flow` if a visual designer is required, but check for existing project conventions first.

### Testing
-   **Testing Strategy**: Component tests are required for the new UI components.
-   **Guidance**: Write component tests for the main components (e.g., Workflow List, Workflow Creator). Given the complexity of the designer, focus on testing the form inputs and state management. Use a library like `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to mock the API responses from story 11.1.5.
