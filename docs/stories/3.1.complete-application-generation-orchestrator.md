# Story 3.1: Complete Application Generation Orchestrator

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Business User,  
**I want** complete business applications generated from my requirements,  
**so that** I receive working software with workflows, forms, integrations, and embedded AI assistants.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application generation orchestrator creates complete business systems from BusinessRequirement input
2. System generates React components, API endpoints, and database schemas as unified applications
3. Generation process includes workflows, dynamic forms, external integrations, and embedded AI chatbots
4. Generated applications deploy to unique URLs with full functionality within 15 minutes
5. Generation status tracking shows real-time progress through each system component creation
6. Error handling provides detailed feedback and recovery options for generation failures
7. Generated code follows enterprise patterns with proper TypeScript types and error handling
8. Applications include comprehensive documentation and user guides automatically

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Generation orchestrator service (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Implement application generation orchestration service with component coordination
  - [ ] Create real-time status tracking with WebSocket progress updates using ws library
  - [ ] Add component generation coordination (workflows, forms, integrations, chatbots)
  - [ ] Implement generation queue management with priority handling
- [ ] Code generation engine (AC: 2, 7)
  - [ ] Implement React component generation with TypeScript and enterprise patterns
  - [ ] Create API endpoint generation with proper Express.js routing and middleware
  - [ ] Add database schema generation following Drizzle ORM patterns
  - [ ] Generate proper error handling and validation throughout generated code
- [ ] System integration (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Integrate workflow, form, integration, and chatbot generation services
  - [ ] Implement application deployment pipeline with unique URL generation
  - [ ] Add 15-minute deployment timeline with progress milestones and validation
  - [ ] Create application testing and validation before deployment
- [ ] Quality assurance (AC: 6, 8)
  - [ ] Implement generation error handling with detailed feedback and recovery
  - [ ] Create automatic documentation generation for generated applications
  - [ ] Add code quality validation and enterprise pattern compliance checking
  - [ ] Generate user guides and technical documentation automatically

## Dev Notes

### Generation Architecture
**Service Pattern**: Application Generation Service Pattern with orchestrated AI services for complete business system creation  
**AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for code generation with enterprise TypeScript templates and patterns  
**Deployment Pipeline**: Replit deployment with unique subdomain assignment and full functionality testing  
**Status Tracking**: WebSocket-based progress updates using GenerationStatus enum for real-time feedback

### Key File Locations
**Core Services**:
- `server/services/applicationGenerationService.ts` - Main generation orchestration
- `server/orchestration/generationOrchestrator.ts` - Component coordination and workflow
- `server/generators/reactComponentGenerator.ts` - React/TypeScript component creation
- `server/generators/apiEndpointGenerator.ts` - Express.js API generation
- `server/generators/databaseSchemaGenerator.ts` - Drizzle schema generation

**Deployment and Validation**:
- `server/deployment/applicationDeployer.ts` - Replit deployment automation
- `server/validation/generatedCodeValidator.ts` - Code quality and pattern compliance
- `server/documentation/autoDocGenerator.ts` - Automatic documentation creation

### API Integration
**Generation Endpoint**: `POST /api/applications/generate`  
**Request**: `{ requirementId: string, generationOptions?: object }`  
**Response**: `GeneratedApplication` schema with deployment URL and component details  
**WebSocket**: `/ws/generation-progress` for real-time status updates  
**Status Endpoint**: `GET /api/applications/generation-status/{id}` for polling fallback

### Generated Application Structure
**Frontend Components**: React/TypeScript with Shadcn UI following established patterns  
**Backend APIs**: Express.js endpoints with proper middleware and error handling  
**Database Schema**: Drizzle ORM tables with relationships and validation  
**Embedded AI**: Chatbot components integrated into generated application UI  
**Business Logic**: Workflow engines, form validation, and integration handlers  
[Source: architecture.md#Frontend Application, architecture.md#GeneratedApplication Data Model]

### Enterprise Patterns and Standards
**TypeScript Compliance**: Strict typing throughout generated code with proper error handling  
**Component Patterns**: Shadcn UI components with consistent styling and accessibility  
**API Standards**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error responses  
**Database Patterns**: Drizzle ORM with migration support and relationship management  
**Security Patterns**: Input validation, authentication middleware, and RBAC integration

### Deployment and Timeline
**15-Minute Target**: Complete application deployment with functional testing within timeline  
**Unique URLs**: Generate and deploy to Replit subdomains with proper routing  
**Progress Milestones**: Component generation → Integration → Testing → Deployment → Validation  
**Error Recovery**: Detailed error reporting with automated recovery and manual intervention options
