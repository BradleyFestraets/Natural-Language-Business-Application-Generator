# Story 7.1.7: Build Core Sales Automation UI

**As a** Sales Representative,
**I want** a dashboard to create and manage quotes and contracts,
**so that** I can streamline the sales process.

## Story Overview

This story creates the user interface for the Sales Automation system. It involves building a dashboard to generate quotes, view their status, and manage contracts. This UI will consume the endpoints from the Sales Automation API (Story 7.1.5).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new page is created at `client/src/pages/sales-dashboard.tsx`.
- [ ] The page provides a form to generate a new sales quote by calling the `POST /api/sales/quotes` endpoint.
- [ ] The dashboard displays a table of existing quotes and contracts, fetched from the API.
- [ ] Users can view the details of a specific quote or contract.
- [ ] The UI is built using `Shadcn UI` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- [ ] State management is handled by `React Query`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Set up Sales Page and Routing**
    - [ ] Create `client/src/pages/sales-dashboard.tsx`.
    - [ ] Add a route (e.g., `/sales`) to the page.

- [ ] **Task 2: Build Quote Generation Form**
    - [ ] Create a component for generating a new quote.
    - [ ] Use `React Query`'s `useMutation` hook to post data to the `POST /api/sales/quotes` endpoint.

- [ ] **Task 3: Build Quotes/Contracts List**
    - [ ] Create a component to display a list of quotes and contracts.
    - [ ] Use `React Query` to fetch data from the API.

- [ ] **Task 4: Build Detail Views**
    - [ ] Create components to display the details of a single quote and a single contract.

## Dev Notes

-   **Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Wouter.
-   **API Endpoints**: This story consumes the endpoints defined in story `7.1.5`.

### Testing
-   **Testing Strategy**: Component tests are required for the new UI components.
-   **Guidance**: Write component tests for the main components (e.g., Quote Form, Contracts Table). Use a library like `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to mock the API responses from story 7.1.5 to test how the components handle loading, success, and error states.
