# Story 2.3: AI-Powered Clarification System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Business User,  
**I want** intelligent clarifying questions when my description is incomplete,  
**so that** generated applications accurately reflect my specific requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System identifies requirement gaps and generates contextually relevant clarifying questions
2. AI asks targeted questions based on business domain and detected process complexity
3. Clarification interface provides examples and suggestions to guide user responses
4. System learns from responses to improve requirement understanding iteratively
5. Clarification process averages <3 questions and completes within 5 minutes
6. AI validates response consistency and asks follow-up questions for contradictions
7. Users can preview understood requirements and modify before application generation
8. Clarification system integrates with requirements refinement API endpoint

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Gap identification system (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Implement requirement completeness analysis using AI
  - [ ] Create contextual question generation based on business domain knowledge
  - [ ] Add process complexity assessment for targeted clarification
  - [ ] Build intelligent gap detection for workflows, forms, and integrations
- [ ] Interactive clarification UI (AC: 3, 7)
  - [ ] Create clarification question interface with examples and suggestions
  - [ ] Implement requirements preview component with modification capabilities
  - [ ] Add visual requirement completeness indicators and progress tracking
  - [ ] Build interactive requirement editing and refinement interface
- [ ] Response validation (AC: 4, 6)
  - [ ] Implement response consistency checking with contradiction detection
  - [ ] Create iterative learning system for improved question generation
  - [ ] Add follow-up question logic for ambiguous or inconsistent responses
  - [ ] Build intelligent conversation flow management
- [ ] Integration and optimization (AC: 5, 8)
  - [ ] Connect to /api/nlp/requirements/{id}/refine endpoint
  - [ ] Optimize question flow to average <3 questions per session
  - [ ] Add session management for clarification state persistence
  - [ ] Implement 5-minute completion timeline with progress optimization

## Dev Notes

### Clarification System Architecture
**AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent question generation with domain-specific prompts  
**API Integration**: Requirements refinement endpoint for iterative improvement  
**State Management**: React Query for clarification session state with persistence  
**UX Optimization**: Progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming users with questions
