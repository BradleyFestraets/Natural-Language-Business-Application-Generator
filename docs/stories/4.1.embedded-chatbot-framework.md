# Story 4.1: Embedded Chatbot Framework

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED**

## Story
**As a** Generated Application,  
**I want** intelligent AI chatbots automatically embedded within my interface,  
**so that** users receive contextual assistance, form help, and process guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chatbot framework automatically embeds AI assistants into generated business applications
2. Embedded chatbots provide contextual assistance based on current application state and user actions
3. Chatbots offer intelligent form completion help with field-specific guidance and validation
4. AI assistants execute actions within applications (send emails, create tasks, update records)
5. Embedded chatbots maintain conversation context across user sessions and application interactions
6. Chatbot framework supports multiple AI models (GPT-4, Claude) with intelligent model selection
7. Generated applications include customizable chatbot personality and knowledge configuration
8. Real-time chatbot communication uses WebSocket for streaming responses and live assistance
