# Story 4.2: Chatbot-User Interaction Management

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED**

## Story
**As an** Embedded AI Chatbot,  
**I want** to manage intelligent interactions with application users,  
**so that** I can provide contextual assistance, execute actions, and maintain conversation continuity.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Chatbot interaction system manages real-time conversations with application users
2. AI assistants provide contextual help based on current form fields, workflow steps, and user actions
3. Chatbots execute business actions (send emails, create tasks, update records) with proper authorization
4. Interaction system maintains conversation history and context across user sessions
5. AI assistants offer proactive guidance and smart suggestions based on user behavior patterns
6. Chatbot responses include confidence scoring and escalation to human support when needed
7. Interaction analytics track user satisfaction, resolution rates, and chatbot effectiveness
8. Multi-language support enables chatbot assistance in user's preferred language
