# Story 5.2: Template Generation System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Platform Administrator,  
**I want** successful applications automatically converted into reusable templates with embedded AI,  
**so that** similar business needs can be deployed rapidly with intelligent assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Template generation system analyzes successful applications to identify reusable patterns
2. System creates parameterized templates from specific applications with configurable business logic
3. Generated templates preserve embedded AI chatbot capabilities and intelligent assistance
4. Template configuration interface allows customization of business rules, workflows, and forms
5. Template validation ensures quality, completeness, and successful deployment capability
6. Template catalog organizes templates by business category with search and discovery features
7. Template deployment creates new applications with customized parameters in <5 minutes
8. Analytics track template usage, success rates, and user satisfaction for continuous improvement
