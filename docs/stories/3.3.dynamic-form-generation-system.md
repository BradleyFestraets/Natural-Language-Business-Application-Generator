# Story 3.3: Dynamic Form Generation System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** System,  
**I want** to generate intelligent forms with validation and conditional logic,  
**so that** generated applications collect data efficiently with embedded AI assistance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Form generator creates dynamic forms with intelligent field types based on business context
2. System generates comprehensive validation rules with custom business logic and error messages
3. Generated forms include conditional field display based on user inputs and workflow state
4. Form components integrate embedded AI chatbots for completion assistance and smart suggestions
5. Generated forms support file uploads, digital signatures, and complex data types
6. Form validation includes real-time AI-powered data quality checking and completeness scoring
7. Generated form UI follows accessibility standards with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
8. Forms automatically save progress and support resumption with session persistence

## Dev Notes

### Form Generation Architecture
**AI-Powered Creation**: Use business requirement context for intelligent form field generation  
**Validation Engine**: Zod schemas with custom validation rules and AI-powered quality checks  
**AI Integration**: OpenAI integration for completion assistance and smart suggestions  
**Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with semantic HTML and proper ARIA implementation
