# Story 9.1.7: Build Core Customer Support UI

**As a** Support Agent,
**I want** a dashboard to view and manage support tickets,
**so that** I can efficiently help customers.

## Story Overview

This story creates the user interface for the Customer Support system. It involves building a dashboard to view and manage support tickets. This UI will consume the endpoints from the Customer Support API (Story 9.1.5).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new page is created at `client/src/pages/support-dashboard.tsx`.
- [ ] The page provides a form to create a new support ticket by calling the `POST /api/support/tickets` endpoint.
- [ ] The dashboard displays a table of existing tickets, fetched from the API.
- [ ] Users can view the details of a specific ticket, including its interaction history.
- [ ] The UI is built using `Shadcn UI` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- [ ] State management is handled by `React Query`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Set up Support Page and Routing**
    - [ ] Create `client/src/pages/support-dashboard.tsx`.
    - [ ] Add a route (e.g., `/support`) to the page.

- [ ] **Task 2: Build Ticket Creation Form**
    - [ ] Create a component for creating a new support ticket.
    - [ ] Use `React Query`'s `useMutation` hook to post data to the `POST /api/support/tickets` endpoint.

- [ ] **Task 3: Build Ticket List**
    - [ ] Create a component to display a list of support tickets.
    - [ ] Use `React Query` to fetch data from the API.

- [ ] **Task 4: Build Ticket Detail View**
    - [ ] Create a component to display the details of a single ticket, including interactions.

## Dev Notes

-   **Tech Stack**: React, Vite, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Wouter.
-   **API Endpoints**: This story consumes the endpoints defined in story `9.1.5`.

### Testing
-   **Testing Strategy**: Component tests are required for the new UI components.
-   **Guidance**: Write component tests for the main components (e.g., Ticket Form, Ticket List). Use a library like `msw` (Mock Service Worker) to mock the API responses from story 9.1.5 to test how the components handle loading, success, and error states.
