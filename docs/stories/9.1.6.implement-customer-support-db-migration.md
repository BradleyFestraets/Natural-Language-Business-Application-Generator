# Story 9.1.6: Implement Customer Support DB Migration

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to create and apply a database migration for the new Customer Support tables,
**so that** the database schema is synchronized with the application's data models.

## Story Overview

This technical story updates the database schema for the Customer Support epic. It involves using Drizzle to generate and apply a migration that creates the tables required by the `customerSupportService.ts`, including `SupportTicket`, `KnowledgeArticle`, and `CustomerHealth`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new SQL migration file is generated using `drizzle-kit`.
- [ ] The migration file contains the `CREATE TABLE` statements for all support-related tables.
- [ ] The migration is successfully applied to the development database.
- [ ] The database schema is inspected and confirmed to match the data models defined in `customerSupportService.ts` and `docs/architecture.md`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Define Support Schemas in `shared/schema.ts`**
    - [ ] Add the Drizzle schema definitions for `supportTickets`, `knowledgeArticles`, and `customerHealth` to `shared/schema.ts` based on the data models in `docs/architecture.md`.

- [ ] **Task 2: Generate and Apply Migration**
    - [ ] Run the `drizzle-kit` command to generate a new migration file.
    - [ ] Review the generated SQL to ensure it is correct.
    - [ ] Run the command to apply the migration to the database.

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify Database Schema**
    - [ ] Connect to the PostgreSQL database and verify that the new tables and columns exist as defined.

## Dev Notes

-   **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
-   **Schema Definition Source**: The data models are defined in `docs/architecture.md`. You will need to translate these into Drizzle schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`.
-   **Tooling**: Use `drizzle-kit` to generate the migration.
