    description: `We need an employee onboarding system where HR submits a new hire form with 
    employee details, then the system sends document collection requests via email. After documents 
    are uploaded, it triggers a background check through an external API. Once the background check 
    is complete, the manager needs to approve the onboarding. If approved, the system should create 
    accounts in various systems and send SMS notifications to IT for equipment setup. The entire 
    process needs audit trails for SOX compliance.`

  {
    name: "Expense Approval Workflow",
    description: `Create an expense report system where employees submit expense forms with receipts. 
    The form should include date, amount, category, and description fields. If the amount is under 
    $500, it goes directly to the manager for approval. For amounts between $500 and $5000, it needs 
    manager approval followed by department head approval. Amounts over $5000 require VP approval. 
    All approvals should have 24-hour timeouts with automatic escalation. The system needs to integrate 
    with our accounting system API and send email notifications at each step.`

  {
    name: "Customer Support Ticketing",
    description: `Build a customer support ticket system with a form for issue description, priority 
    level, and file attachments. Tickets should be automatically routed based on category - technical 
    issues go to IT, billing to Finance, and general inquiries to Customer Service. Each department 
    has different SLA requirements. High priority tickets need immediate SMS alerts to on-call staff. 
    The system should integrate with our CRM database and provide real-time dashboard updates. We 
    need AI chatbot assistance for common issues and ticket status inquiries.`
