## Key Design Principles

### Intelligence Conveyed Through:
- Subtle gradients on interactive elements
- Smooth micro-animations for state changes
- Clean data visualization with meaningful insights

### Trust Building:
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Professional color palette with high contrast ratios
- Clear labeling and predictable interactions

### Enterprise Quality:
- Scalable component system
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Dark mode support for extended usage

## Images Section
**Hero Image:** No large hero image - enterprise platforms focus on functionality over marketing visuals
**Supporting Images:** 
- Small company logos in client testimonial sections
- Subtle abstract geometric patterns as background textures
- Screenshot mockups of the platform in action (displayed within device frames)
- Professional headshots for team/testimonial sections (circular crops, consistent sizing)

Place images strategically to support content without overwhelming the professional interface aesthetic.
